    <h4>
        What was the problem?
    </h4>
    <p>
        The problem that I had while I was working on Javascript was that JS was completely new thing
        for me (and I still don't know fully how to use JS at this point). For instance I knew there
        was if else statement, for statement to use but I didn't know how. 
    </p>
    <h4>
        What problem solving techniques did you use?
    </h4>
    <p>
        First of all I tried to solve questions myself but because I had no idea how to solve the 
        question myself I looked up on google, sometimes the answer it self so I know how JS works
        and then I trace back so I understand what the question is rather than just copy and pasting.
        I asked Harrison at the end because I really could not understand how JS work. It was hard but 
        as Harrison adviced drawing how the Javascript might look like in the end visually helped me more.
    </p>
    <h4>
        How did you feel throughout the process?
    </h4>
    <p>
        It was like learning math (but not math) all from the beginning. You just need to get used
        to how JS works and because JS is more mechanical than visual.
    </p>
    <h4>
        What did you learn?
    </h4>
    <p>
        Instead of trying to work on small contents first I need to know what JS function is needed
        to be used in order to make things work, for instance I need for function for some but in other
        JS I need if else function. 
    </p>
    <h3>
        Elegant solution?
    </h3>

    <p>
       Not really.. JS is not like CSS I can't really see it visually before I make JS working beforehand.
       Although in order to count something I know I need to use for and in order to list something out and 
       make things stop when the result has been given I need to use if else statement. 
    </p>


    <h3>
        Reflect..
    </h3>

    <p>
        I am good at trying something but also breaking something as well. I am learning how to do
        console logging and I read error messages but I don't think I fully understand how to solve this yet.
         I am good at googling but I can spend ages doing this because I need extra
        explanantion. I think I am fairly confident asking coaches for help but I try not to because
        I have to try first before I reach out to them they are my last option. Asking peers and 
        improving my process with reflection would be the weakness for me because I tend to have 
        break if nothing works out for me but I know there are friendly and intelligent peers out there.
