    <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
    
<p>
    I know I should follow this concept but as I am a design graduate I tend to make website until It looks 
    perfect but perfect website does not exist from the first place so it takes long time to build it to 
    the stage that I am satisfied with. It doesn’t necessarily mean that I do not value the process I 
    understand that process matters and it is more important than the product because you learn lots of 
    things in-between process. I am still learning how to value the process more.

<h3>
    What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?    
</h3>

<p>
    I knew in real world meditation is about mental training and It is about giving yourself time to 
    relax so you can strengthen your inner self but the thing is because there are ‘fantasy’ movies or 
    comics where heroes meditate to use their magical power sometimes I think meditation might be related 
    to those magical stuff as well. (even though I know it has nothing to do with magic in my head).
</p>


<h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
<p>
    Mediation is exercise for your mind just like work out at the gym is exercise for our body. You can 
    meditate in any posture you want. I thought you had to cross your leg and sit up straight. 
</p>


<h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
<p>
    “The third thing to do is to become aware of your attitude toward yourself. See how you treat yourself 
    and how often you engage in nasty gossip about yourself. If possible, shift the attitude toward 
    self-directed kindness and curiosity.”
</p>


<h3>Any other musings?</h3>
<p>
    Not really!.
