    <h3>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional 
        response?
    </h3>

    <p>
        I get triggers when I am programming minesweepers.. haha. I get anxious that I can't make
        the game work and I get triggered again that I don't understand simple Javascript. 
        Now I am okay but it took me a while to get over this emotion. Learning new thing is hard 
        and I just have to be more kind to my self. I am here to learn not to test my self.

    <h3>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, 
        Respond)?
    </h3>

    <p>
        Siberian North Railroad exercise helps to manage negative emotion. Stop especially helps,
        by pausing and looking back at what our selves look like we can handle triggers.
