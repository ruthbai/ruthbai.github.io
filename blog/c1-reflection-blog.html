    <h2>Reflection based on the video <em> https://vimeo.com/85001014 </em> </h2>


    <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
    
<p>I want to experiment more throughout the course and I would like to learn something new and make amazing things. </p>

<h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
<p>I tend to get into restaurant mind set when I am not confident enough, first when I came to devs 
    academy blocked on how to git push I thought ‘this is not what I have ordered’.  
    Harrison and Phase 0 students have been lot of help for me and as I began to solve problems that 
    I could not solve and as I am able to help others as well I am slowly beginning to be in kitchen 
    mind set. </p>


<h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
<p>When I was in university I took open lab paper as a summer school. Basically we needed to code Arduino, 
    knew how to do GitHub, knew how to do some of the adobe programs and using machines to make a product 
    which I did not know because I did not study in that area. It was not easy I was in despair lot of the 
    times but at that time we were all in kitchen mindset everyone helped each other and everyone went 
    through same problem but we eventually got there. I enjoyed it, I was able to help people with the 
    new skills that I have learnt it was the hardest paper I have done but I know that kind of creator 
    mind set actually helps us create most amazing thing at the end. </p>


<h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
<p>I was afraid that I might not be the best student for this course. I was never good at coding 
    and I was always stressed when I was but I saw many students who tried to help each other because 
    they went through exactly same issues and problems and I think it will be the same when we graduate 
    this course and go out to the industry. I am trying to self learn and I expect EDA to help me put my 
    creator mind set on and keep pushing me until I can manage to create website by myself. </p>



<h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
<p>I am nervous about breaking things but I am excited that I will do it better next time.</p>
