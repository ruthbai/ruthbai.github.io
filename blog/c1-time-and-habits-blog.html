    <h2>Reflection on <em> Times and Habits </em> </h2>

<h3>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
<p>The Habits of Successful People: They Have a Growth Mindset</p>

<h3>what did you find interesting?</h3>
<p>“Prove it to yourself in small ways and you’ll develop the confidence that you can improve.” 
    In other words, small wins repeated over time can lead to a growth mindset.” (James clear)
    </p>
<p>I find this interesting because I actually feel happy about my self trying small new things in coding 
    and solving little problems. One day I am sure this small things will all build together and let me 
    be a good website designer but I understand that I need to repeat and prove to my self that I can 
    code in order to become confident </p>

<h3>what worked for you?</h3>
<p>I understand that I am not the best when it gets to coding but I know that everyone started at the 
    same line. No one is born with the ability to code and same with me. Depending on people some might 
    have better understanding about how to code. If I practice over and over again and use same commands 
    over and over again I am sure one day I will be confident in myself. Without the action nothing is 
    going to happen!. Little things count. </p>

<h3>which will you experiment further with?</h3>
<p>I am going acknowledge that I am not going to know 100% of coding but I am going to keep pushing my self 
to learn new things everyday so I become confident in my self. Start with little things and think about big 
later on..! </p>
