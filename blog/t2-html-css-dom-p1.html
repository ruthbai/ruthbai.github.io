<h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
 
<p>The most basic analogy that I can think of is thinking html as a structure of a house so basically html is used to build a house (website)
    and then css would be interiors and exteriors of the house so css makes html look pretty,modern,fancy etc depending on how you use it.
    Dom is almost like a house plan you can see how the house is built and you can modify delete move around the structure of the house without actually touching the actual structure of the house (html)

<h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>

<p>All of the elements on website is made out of box. Complicated looking websites are also made out of box as well but you need more boxes than the other simple website to create it
    Boxifying design means looking at websites and thinking it as a grid to place logos, images, text and many others.
</p>

 <h3>What is the box model?</h3>

 <p>Box model is basically boxes around the object such as texts and images. We call this margin, border and padding. This box allows people to give space around this objects and you can adjust size of the box as well.
     This box is not viewable on website but only on html. Think of this box model as a clear bubble around images and texts that keeps things away from other objects. </p>
