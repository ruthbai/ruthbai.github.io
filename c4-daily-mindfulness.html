<h3>
    What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?
</h3>
<p>
    Mindful conversation involves mindful listening ,looping which is returning your own opinion or thoughts after someone has 
    spoken this will help understand what they have talked about and they will appreciate it more because you were concentrating 
    on their talking and lastly dipping or cheking in with ourselves which means noticing and acknowledging them. You give full 
    moment to moment attention to other person with non judgemental mind.
    Mindfulness conversation is the way to respect others and also they will feel more satisfied in the conversation.
</p>

<h3>
    Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?
</h3>
<p>
    I think 'dipping' is the technique that I should practice more. Giving full moment to moment attention could be really hard
    when there are lot of things going around you but if you practice this technique would get better.
</p>

<h3>
    Any other musings?
</h3>
<p>
    Not really.
