    <h3>What is responsive site and why is it important?</h3>
    
<p>
    Responsive site is a site that users can easily navigate regardless on what device they are using. 
    In an easy word you can view responsive site on mobiles, i pad, desktop and other devices without the website screen cutting off, text size being too small and so on.
    Responsive site is important because it is user friendly and it is much more easier to navigate responsive site than the none responsive site. 
</p>

<h3>What is mobile first design? and why is it important?</h3>
<p>
    Mobile first design is when website developers make their html and css file 
    for the website they start off testing this file with a small screen not on the big screen.
    In easy word they test what website might look like on the mobile screen than desktop screen. 
    Mobile first design is important because if you start off designing on the big screen later on 
    when you would like to design for the small screen website developers would need to take out many 
    elements that they have used for the big screen because they can't fit eveything on a small screen.
    It is more efficient if you design mobile first.

<h3>What is framework and what are the pros and cons?</h3>
<p>
    I guess framework is the basic structure of making the website. This involves columns and rows of the website, navigation that would always be on your site, logo or 
    footer if you need them and so on. Basically If you think of the website as a burger columns, rows, navigation and other things that would always be on the website is 
    hamburger buns and all the other contents that would change would be other ingredients.. 
    The pros of having framework is that it takes less time if you have basic structure of the website and the cons 
    would be because you normally copy and paste this basic structure you might forget how to use certain html or css, and also 
    the layout could get a bit repetitive. 
</p>


<h3>What is a wireframe and why do we use it?</h3>
<p>
    Wireframe is a mock up drawing of your website before you start making the actual one. We use this so we
    have basic outline of what our website might look like and how the navigation would work and so on. 
</p>


    <img src="images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="max-width: 30em" alt="blog page desktop" /> 
    <img src="images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="max-width: 30em" alt="blog page desktop" /> 
    <img src="images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="max-width: 30em" alt="blog page desktop" /> 
    <img src="images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="max-width: 30em" alt="blog page desktop" /> 



<h3>The difficult aspects that I find difficult to implement from my wire frames</h3>
<p>
    At this stage I have struggled to use rows and columns for the blog page but I have partially managed to make similar look
    but without javascript I don't think I can make a navigation tool that works like a tab.. I can create a tab but it
    would not look like the wireframe that I have drawn. Otherwise they are similar looking.
