    <h3>
        What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        Self awareness involves being honest to yourself, this helps to assess ourselves accurately and objectively
        see our greatest strengths and our biggest weaknesses. When we become honest to ourselves we get comfortable
        in our status. This doesn't necessarily mean that we let go of ourselves, because we know who we are clearly
        we can learn in better ways.
        Being mindful helps us to respect others this involves giving full moment to moment attention to other person
        while having a conversation. This would allow other person to feel more satisfied while having a conversation.
        Relationship between mindfulness and self awareness would be both mindfulness and self awareness involves people.
        being mindful please others, having self awareness please yourself and make yourself satisfied.

    <h3>
        Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What 
        was your experience of it? How did you feel?
    </h3>

    <p>
        I felt much more calming. Giving a break by body scan helped me to thank that I am a living person.

    <h3>
        What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?
    </h3>

    <p>
        My Emotions are not me, what I feel is not actually who I am. Even if I just feel sad and tired sometimes
        It doesn't mean that I am a sad tired person. My feeling does not define who I am because I will get over
        it at some point. We have multiples of feeling and it can't define who I am I am just me and I am happy.
