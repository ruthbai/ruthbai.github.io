    <h3>
        What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        When I was working at the sushi shop for 4 years our manager who used to look after all of
        the shops would listen to all of the worker's concerns regardless of their status. I 
        guarantee she was very busy she had lots of works to do but she really meant it, she really
        fealt for others and would try to fix it on our behalf. I think that was a compassionate
        leadership.

    <h3>
        Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?
    </h3>

    <p>
        I found it calming, if you find goodness in yourself and others it helps you feel happy 
        that you are living in a good world. 
    </p>


    <h3>
        Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?
    </h3>

    <p>
        I guess there are times when we suffer but it is not that bad after all when you think
        about it. Tonglen meditation lets you think about hard times in a more logical way therefore
        you can overcome this bad feeling by just simply accepting who you are as a ordinary person.

    <h3>
        How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to 
        bootcamp?
    </h3>

    <p>
        I guess Phase 0 applies in many ways to the SCARF model. You are in the environment where
        you can feel lonely and feel uncomfortable and you also meet new people so you could be
        embarassed. Phase 0 was hard because you had to be in environment where you learn new 
        things by yourself but if we start bootcamp I guess I will make new friends (relatedness) 
        and be more opened up. 
    </p>

    <h3>
        Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take 
        practice to develop!)
    </h3>

    <p>
        I guess i tend to talk straight away when I have to speak up but sometimes it is hard
        for me to start the conversation especially when I need to talk to the people older than
        me. It is cultural thing more than I find it difficult to talk to the older people. I 
        know I have to respect them so I tend to think more and try not to speak difficult 
        conversation with them. I was married in December 2017 but still haven't got my photo
        printed from my photographer who is my dad's friend and it is already March. 
        It was difficult to ask same questions but I managed to get it printed and it will be 
        delievered soon..!. Sometimes I just have to be patient.
