        Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? 
        How did it go?
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        Yes I always try to trust other people and if I try to be truthful and be honest most of people 
        tend to trust me back. Not everyone does sometimes it takes long time to build trust but opening up
        first definitely helps.

    <h3>
        Try empathic listening - how did it go?
    </h3>
         
    <p>
        Like I said before giving full attention to people are not easy especially when many things are 
        happening around you but when you do give full attention to others and listen carefully you will actually
        feel for them and also they would notice that you are actually concentrating on the conversation.

    <h3>
        How did you find the loving kindness meditation?
    </h3>

    <p>
        Wishing for someone to be happy is completely normal thing. If you are happy you want others to be 
        happy. If you are not happy you still would like others to be happy because you know how it feels
        like when you are unhappy.

       1 . When I tell my husband to not stack dishes too much because it could fall and break.
       2. If the dishes fall and break hubby could hurt himself while he is doing dishes so I'm 100% correct
       3. But he was nearly done with dishes and he was about to clear it so he is 100% correct as well, as long 
       as he clears it right away it does not matter. 
       “The main purpose of this exercise is to practice seeing the perspectives of different players”
