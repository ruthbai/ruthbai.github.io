    <h3>
        How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        They have varying sustainability. The happiness that arises from pleasure is highly 
        unsustainable.
        Happiness that arises from flow is much more sustainable and you are far less likely to 
        habituate to it. Happiness arising from higher purpose, in contrast, is highly sustainable. 
        In Tonyâ€™s and also my own experience, this form of happiness is very resilient and can last 
        for a very long time. The life look through the pleasure passion and purpose lens looks like 
        if we chase our pleasure and do not have have higher purpose for the future we are likely to 
        be unhappy and get lost. 
    </p>

    <h3>
        From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,
        *What are your core values?
        *What do you stand for?
    </h3>
        My Core value is to be happy and just do what I can do for my careers and life eventhough I 
        can't see what my future would look like. 
    <p>
        I stand for others. I want them to be happy and find purpose in their life as well. 
    </p>


    <h3>
        How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?
    </h3>

    <p>
        When I think about the moment that I had experience failure I still do feel sad. As a 
        human being you make mistakes and you regret but the failures that you have experienced
        all make who you are now. Because of the failure you learn and become better person every
        time. You still need help because you are naive but failures does not judge who you are. 
    </p>
